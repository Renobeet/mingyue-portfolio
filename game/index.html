<h1>Tea Garden Guardian</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Tea Garden Guardian</strong> is a wave-based top-down shooter
  originally developed in <em>Processing (Java)</em> for IAT 167 and
  later adapted to <em>p5.js</em> for web deployment.
</p>

<p>
  The game places the player in the role of a tea spirit tasked with
  protecting a peaceful tea garden from progressively challenging
  enemy waves, culminating in a boss encounter.
</p>

<p>
  This project explores object-oriented programming, game state
  management, enemy behavior design, and player feedback through
  visual effects, HUD elements, and power-up systems.
